# Vision 
For any eager Dundonian who is willing to improve sustainability in Dundee, the Sustainable Development Goal web application provides information about 17 goals as well as their progress in the city.

Unlike older sustainability apps, our products encourage user interaction by displaying many different events and projects which they can take part in, allowing the people of Dundee to help make the city more environmentally, socially and economically prosperous. On top of thatâ€¦
# Scope
### What is the scope of the project? 
The aim of the project is with the help of the local government of Dundee to support the sustainable life in the city by raising awareness of the locals of possible events and organisations that they can take part in and in this way contribute to the sustainability of the city. This is planned to be done through creating an application which could display UN goals and their related events organised in Dundee.
### Why is the project being undertaken? 
Ever since COP26, the call to action on environmental change has been increasingly important. We are living in a time where we must act now to prevent further damage inflicted on the planet. This project is being created to raise awareness on these current issues and hopefully inspire people to make a difference.
### Who will be impacted because of the project? 
The project is designed to encourage people to improve the city which hopefully in doing so will improve themselves.
### When will the project start and end ?
The implementation of the project will take 2 weeks starting from the 24th January and finishing on the 4th February.
### Where will the project occur? 
The project will be developed remotely through online meetings with product owner, scrum master and development team.
### How will the project be executed?
Using a number of resources. These include GitHub to programme the project, Microsoft Teams to communicate, Google docs to create documents such as the Sprint Backlog, Microsoft Azure to create an API and database to be used in the website, and a mapbox to integrate a map feature.
