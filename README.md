# Project Charter - UN Sustainable Development Goal Activity in Dundee
# Vision 
For any eager Dundonian who is willing to improve sustainability in Dundee, the Sustainable Development Goal web application provides information about 17 goals as well as their progress in the city.

Unlike older sustainability apps, our products encourage user interaction by displaying many different events and projects which they can take part in, allowing the people of Dundee to help make the city more environmentally, socially and economically prosperous. On top of that…
# Scope
### What is the scope of the project? 
The aim of the project is with the help of the local government of Dundee to support the sustainable life in the city by raising awareness of the locals of possible events and organisations that they can take part in and in this way contribute to the sustainability of the city. This is planned to be done through creating an application which displays UN goals and their related events organised in Dundee with additional functionalities being added. Project is subjected to change due to  requests of the client.
### Why is the project being undertaken? 
Ever since COP26, the call to action on environmental change has been increasingly important. We are living in a time where we must act now to prevent further damage inflicted on the planet. This project is being created to raise awareness on these current issues and hopefully inspire people to make a difference.
### Who will be impacted because of the project? 
The project is designed to encourage people to improve the city which hopefully in doing so will improve themselves.
### When will the project start and end ?
The implementation of the project will take 3 weeks starting from the 24th January and finishing on the 11th February with 3 sprints being carried out , each of 1 week length. 
### Where will the project occur? 
The project will be developed remotely through online meetings with product owner, scrum master and development team.
### How will the project be executed?
Using a number of resources. These include GitHub to programme the project, Microsoft Teams to communicate, Google docs to create documents such as the Sprint Backlog.

The scrum methodology is expected to be used while implementing the project including creation of a product backlog, sprint backlog, burnout chart. The iterative process of the software development will be supported by holding daily scrum meetings as well as following other scrum processes like pair programming. As constant client’s feedback is of vital importance, sprint reviews will be taking place at the end of each sprint.
